# Graders please be aware
In this peer-review project, I came across a lot of learners that export the tidy data as .csv
However, the assignment was instructed to export the file as .txt
I have given the credits to these learners as long as you didn't violate the tidy data principles(Each variable you measure should be in one column, Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row).

At this time, I think a lot of learners have noticed that exporting as .txt the dataset will not seem to be neat,
but according to the principles, they are still tidy data.
For the sake of fairness, no matter you came across a .csv file or .txt file please take a closer look,
and grade it according to the principle not appearance. 

Thank you!
