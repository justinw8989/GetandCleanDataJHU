# GetandCleanDataJHU
## Project Objective
  1. merge the train and test datasets to one dataset
  2. extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  3. uses descriptive activity names for the activities in the dataset
  4. appropriately label the dataset with descriptive variable names
  5. create a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject

## Procedures
  1. set working directory (I used a default wd)
  2. download the data source and extract the file to the working directory
  3. run source("run_analysis.R") to generate the tidy dataset(.txt) in the working directory
